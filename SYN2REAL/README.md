### Environmental Setup
Run the following commands to build up the environment

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Synthetic Data Generation
Synthesize speech given text from SLURP dataset with BARK model

```
$ source slurm_scripts/generate.sh
```

### ASR Training

#### Train pretrained ASR models with source/target domain real and synthetic data

```
$ source slurm_scripts/train.sh
```
#### Train pretrained ASR models with source domain (i.e. source domain ASR, mixture of real and synthetic data)

```
$ source slurm_scripts/train_mix.sh
```

#### Train above source domain ASR models with target domain synthetic data (second stage)

```
$ source slurm_scripts/train_mix_continue.sh
```

### ASR Evaluation

#### Traditional ASR evaluation
```
$ source slurm_scripts/test.sh
```

#### ASR evaluation with SYN2REAL task vector
```
$ source slurm_scripts/test_vector.sh
```
